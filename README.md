# google-news

##Purpose
Simple application that calls news from a API via JavaScript.
It's responsive and includes a JS built search funtionality.

## Compiling SASS
`cd` into the project directory (where the style.scss file is in the sass folder).
Run `sass --watch style.scss ../style.css` `SASS` will output all the CSS files into the `assets/css` folder.
Make sure you have SASS installed.

## Git
Please use branches accordingly. For all new changes, branch off of `master` and create your own feature branch for example `my-change`. Test your branch changes, and only when it is working, merge the branch into master.

## File structure
All the functionality is in `assets/js/request.js`. I've tried to add as many comments as possible to explain what I've built.
